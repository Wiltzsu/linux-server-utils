# Linux Server Utilities

A collection of Linux server-related tools, scripts, and configuration instructions that I use in my own servers and projects. This includes everything from PHP configuration tips to database backup scripts.

The goal is to provide a structured, reusable, and documented set of utilities for everyday sysadmin tasks.
